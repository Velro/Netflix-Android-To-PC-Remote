Netflix-Android-To-PC-Remote
============================

Im sick of having to hit play when Netflix asks me if I am still there when binging. Plan is to have a listener app that runs on the PC, and a remote app on Android. Desktop continues play by emulating windows space bar, or possibly moves the mouse to a predefined location and emulates a mouse click. 

Android app is just a big button that sends a network command at the PC.

In-Progress
